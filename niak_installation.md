Currently, NIAK has been tested in Ubuntu as well as CentOS. The package reads and writes MINC files. Both MINC1 and MINC2 are supported. MINC1 files may in addition be compressed (extension .gz). Support for 4D NIFTI files is experimental. 

# Basic installation

Click the "Download" button above for the latest release. Once the library has been decompressed, all you need to do is to start a Matlab or Octave session and add the NIAK path (with all his subfolders) to your search path. At this stage you have access to all matlab/octave functions of the NIAK.
```matlab
 path_niak = '/data/aces/aces1/pbellec/public/niak/'; 
 P = genpath(path_niak); 
 addpath(P); 
``` 
# MINC tools

To read MINC files or run the fMRI preprocessing pipeline, it is necessary to install the [minc toolkit](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/ServicesSoftwareMincToolKit). 
> * Binaries/packages are currently available for Ubuntu, Debian and Mac OSX, making the installation seamless on those systems.
> * Compilation is usually required on other platforms.

# Matlab/Octave

To use NIAK, you will need a recent version of [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/) or [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index.html). In addition to Matlab/Octave, NIAK depends on the "image processing" and "statistics" toolbox. This comes by default with Matlab. In Octave, you have to download it from [Octave forge](http://octave.sourceforge.net/index.html).
> * In octave, you will need to install the following toolboxes (in that order): specfun-1.1.0 control-2.4.2 general-1.3.2 signal-1.2.2 image-2.0.0 io-1.2.2 statistics-1.2.0 

For Octave users, we suggest editing the `~/.octaverc` to change octave's default behaviour. 
```matlab
% Verbose in real time
more off
% Use the same .mat files as Matlab
default_save_options('-7');
```

# The brain connectivity toolbox  

The connectome pipeline is using some measures generated by the [brain connectivity toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) (BCT). The BCT needs to be downloaded and added to the search path of matlab or octave for this pipeline to work. 

# Configuration of the pipeline manager

NIAK is using a pipeline system called [PSOM](http://psom.simexp-lab.org). In all pipelines, the options of psom are set using the field `opt.psom`. More details about PSOM capabilities and configuration can be found in the dedicated [tutorial](http://psom.simexp-lab.org/psom_configuration.html).
