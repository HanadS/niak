The neuroimaging analysis kit (NIAK) is a library of pipelines for the preprocessing and mining of connectomes extracted from large functional magnetic resonance imaging data, using GNU [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/)(r). NIAK is an open-source software distributed under [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The current release ("BOSS" 0.12.4) is unstable (beta) software, under active development. Linux operating systems and MINC imaging files are currently supported. 

#Features
PSOM includes a versatile, robust pipeline for the preprocessing of fMRI datasets. Other pipelines are available to cluster the brain into multiscale network decomposition, using either resting-state or slow event-related task datasets. Finally, some multiple statistical testing pipelines based on the general linear model can be applied to either multiscale connectomes or task-evoked dynamics. NIAK offeres flexible statistical models, both within-run, within-subject and across subjects.

#Contributions
NIAK is developed by the [SIMEXP lab](http://simexp-lab.org), located at "[Unité de Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle](http://www.unf-montreal.ca/)" (UNF), "[Centre de Recherche de l'Institut de Gériatrie de Montréal](http://www.criugm.qc.ca/)" (CRIUGM), "[Département d'Informatique et de Recherche Opérationnelle](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/)" (DIRO), [Université de Montréal](http://www.umontreal.ca/). >The project was started by [Pierre Bellec](http://simexp-lab.org/brainwiki/doku.php?id=pierrebellec) when he worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of [Alan Evans](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~alan/) at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada.
