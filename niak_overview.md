The neuroimaging analysis kit (NIAK) is a library of pipelines for the preprocessing and mining of connectomes extracted from large functional magnetic resonance imaging data, using GNU [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/)(r). NIAK is an open-source software distributed under [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The current version of NIAK ("BOSS" 0.12.4) is an unstable (beta) release. Linux operating systems and MINC imaging files are currently supported. 

#Features
 NIAK includes a comprehensive and robust **preprocessing pipeline** for structural and fMRI datasets. **Clustering pipelines** are available to generate multiscale network brain decomposition, using either resting-state or slow event-related task datasets. **Statistical testing pipelines** based on the general linear model can be applied to either multiscale connectomes or task-evoked dynamics, including both within-run, within-subject and group level modeling.
